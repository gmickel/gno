The converter receives bytes already loaded, so the size check is too late to prevent OOM.\n\nSolution: In EPIC 5 indexing pipeline, check file.size via stat BEFORE calling converter.convert(). If file exceeds maxBytes, skip conversion and record TOO_LARGE error without reading file bytes.\n\nThis keeps converter API clean (bytes already available) while preventing memory issues.","created_at":"2025-12-24T08:00:14Z"}]}

Raycast is ideal because it's keyboard-driven, React/TypeScript-based (same stack as GNO), and deeply integrated into macOS workflows.\n\n## Why Raycast\n\n1. **Same tech stack** - React + TypeScript + Node, minimal context switch\n2. **Keyboard-first** - matches CLI power-user mindset\n3. **Native performance** - no Electron overhead, instant access via hotkey\n4. **Rich UI primitives** - List, Detail, Form, Grid, Actions, Menu Bar\n5. **AI integration** - built-in hooks for AI features (useAI)\n6. **Large ecosystem** - 5000+ extensions, proven patterns to follow\n\n## Core Commands\n\n### 1. Search Notes (gno search)\n- Component: List with search bar\n- Features: Instant FTS search, tag filtering, collection scoping\n- Actions: Open in editor, Quick Look preview, copy content/path\n\n### 2. Semantic Search (gno vsearch)\n- Component: List with search bar\n- Features: Vector similarity, hybrid mode toggle, relevance scores\n\n### 3. Ask Question (gno ask)\n- Component: Form then Detail\n- Flow: Question input then streaming answer with citations\n- Features: Citation links, copy answer, regenerate, view context\n\n### 4. Quick Capture\n- Component: Form with title, content, collection, tags\n\n### 5. Browse Collections\n- Component: List chain (Collections, Documents, Detail)\n- Features: Collection stats, document metadata, trigger re-index\n\n### 6. Status Dashboard (Menu Bar)\n- Features: Index health, last sync, quick actions, model status\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nIntegration via CLI wrapper (spawn gno commands, parse JSON).\nLater: direct library import or MCP client.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n1. T13.1: Raycast extension scaffold\n2. T13.2: GNO CLI wrapper with JSON parsing\n3. T13.3: Search command (FTS)\n4. T13.4: Semantic search command\n5. T13.5: Ask command with streaming\n6. T13.6: Quick capture form\n7. T13.7: Browse collections\n8. T13.8: Menu bar status\n9. T13.9: Raycast Store submission\n\n## Resources\n\n- Raycast Developer Docs: https://developers.raycast.com\n- Extensions Repo: https://github.com/raycast/extensions\n- Obsidian Extension (reference): https://www.raycast.com/marcjulian/obsidian\n","created_at":"2025-12-24T08:11:51Z"}]}
