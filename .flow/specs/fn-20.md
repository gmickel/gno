# Logseq link format support

**Migrated from:** gno-dn2
**Original type:** feature
**Priority:** P3

---

Support Logseq-specific link syntax.

## Logseq Differences

1. **Alias syntax**: `[Display]([[PageTitle]])` instead of `[[PageTitle|Display]]`
2. **Block references**: `((block-id))` - links to specific blocks
3. **Page embedding**: `{{embed [[PageTitle]]}}`
4. **Block embedding**: `{{embed ((block-id))}}`

## Scope

- [ ] Parse `[text]([[target]])` as wiki link with display text
- [ ] Optionally parse block refs (may need block-level indexing)
- [ ] Handle embeds as links (without embed semantics)

## Notes

Logseq files are markdown-compatible, basic `[[Note]]` links already work.
This is for full Logseq vault compatibility.
