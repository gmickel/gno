# Review and update CLI defaults

**Migrated from:** gno-n9l
**Original type:** task
**Priority:** P2

---

Review CLI defaults after search improvements.

## Current Defaults

- \`gno query\` limit: 20
- \`gno ask\` limit: 5
- Answer max tokens: 512

## Proposed

- \`gno query\` limit: 20 (keep)
- \`gno ask\` limit: 5 (keep, but now with full docs)
- Answer max tokens: 1024 (increase for fuller answers)

## Considerations

- Full document content now passed to LLM
- Fewer docs but richer context
- May need to adjust based on testing

## Testing Required

- Verify answer quality with new limits
- Check latency impact
- Validate context window usage

Blocks: gno-5hk
Low priority - do after implementation and testing.
