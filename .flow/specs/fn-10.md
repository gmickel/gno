# MCP: gno_sync should trigger embedding (or add gno_embed tool)

**Migrated from:** gno-f8a
**Original type:** bug
**Priority:** P2

---

MCP server lacks gno_index and gno_embed tools. Agents using MCP write tools (gno_sync, gno_capture) have no way to trigger embedding. Either add gno_index (sync+embed) or gno_embed tool, or have gno_sync optionally embed.
