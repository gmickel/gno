# GNO

> Local knowledge indexing and semantic search CLI. Indexes documents locally, provides BM25/vector/hybrid search, and generates AI answers using local LLMs. Privacy-first: all processing happens on your machine.

GNO helps you build a personal knowledge base from your documents (Markdown, PDF, DOCX, etc.) and search it semantically. It supports MCP integration for AI assistants like Claude.
